# Leaflet Challenge
Northwestern University Data Science Boot Camp

Homework 17

In this project, I utilized HTML, JavaScript and the D3 and leaflet libraries to map earthquakes in Central America. I obtained the last 30 days of mid-tier earthquake data from the [United States Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_month.geojson). I then plotted the earthquakes on a map from [MapBox.com](mapbox.com) with styling based on magnitude and depth of the earthquakes. There are also light and dark options for viewing the map as well as the ability to turn off the earthquake layer.
